# File-To-Byte
simple file to byte save your time and do more coding !



heres a nice little application that took me 2 minutes to code but yeah as it says instead of dragging your file into a hxd every time now just drag and drop your file onto the filetobye.exe and boom open the txt folder that gets created and there you go there is your bytes automaticallyy in C
